We advance research opportunity evaluation investigating people may diverge views defines attractive business opportunity. Using unique data conjoint experiment 141 respondents ( 6,728 opportunity evaluations) , analysis reveals significant differences opportunity preferences. We also find people specialist experience ( technology) emphasize fewer opportunity dimensions people generalist experience ( management , entrepreneurship ) . Debating Points : • Influence opportunity selection performance ? • Relevance SMEs large firms ? • How insights used teaching ? 2
Entrepreneurial opportunity allows value generation key driver entrepreneurial action throughout new firm creation process. Research investigating people heterogeneous experience may diverge views constitutes attractive business opportunity. In present paper, we address key desideratum entrepreneurship research investigating people’ experience endowments affects subjective judgments opportunity attractiveness – i.e. opportunity “ prototypes ” ( Baron Ensley , 2006) and opportunity ‘ templates ’ ( Barreto , 2012) We also address 3 aspects opportunities particularly appealing people different experience backgrounds. We conclude by looking at 3 aspects of opportunity attractiveness that may be particularly appealing to people different experienced backgrounds – the ‘creativity’, ‘imagination’ and ‘empathy’ aspects of the opportunity attractiveness. We also look at the 3 aspects that may make the opportunity particularly appealing – the creativity, the imagination and the “creative” aspect. We end with a discussion of the 3 types of people involved in the entrepreneurial process – people experience management, technology entrepreneurship and people experience entrepreneurship – and how they differ from each other in terms of their ability to make decisions about business opportunities.

Our empirical analysis business opportunity evaluations based on unique data set combines experimental questionnaire data. In total , data captures 6,728 opportunity evaluation decisions nested sample 141 individuals. We combine conjoint data questionnaire information experience backgrounds individuals participating study. We seek understand characteristics opportunities systematically preferred individuals technological , managerial entrepreneurial experience , , explore content shape opportunity templates. , may may ‘ practical. ’ ” Core theoretical development recent insights research entrepreneurial cognition ( Baron Ensley , 2006 ; Wood et al. , 2013 ) suggesting agents ’ experience shape understanding attractive business opportunity ( opportunity template ) .
Business opportunities understood market imperfections allow agents obtain economic benefits introducing new and/or improved offerings better serve customer needs. Given exploitation opportunities typically requires agents commit substantial amounts resources ( terms time, attention, financial investments, social capital etc. ) In evaluation activities, agents interpret signals acquire information channels. In creation approach, agents consider either sufficient information major dimensions specific opportunities assessing opportunity ’ potential value creation. In words, agents develop understanding opportunity form opportunity beliefs interpreting environmental information cues ( McMullen Shepherd , 2006 ) . Given opportunity discovered critical information cues presented , expend limited cognitive analytical effort imposing opportunity template ( ) opportunity-related information ( Barreto , 2012 ) . In creation approach, agents identify business opportunities alert exogenous changes establish possibility obtain economic benefits. They observe external environment assess business opportunities arising changes technology, customer preferences and/ or attributes context ( Kirzner , 1979 ; Fiet , 2007 ) . Because opportunities created exogenous changes , objective phenomena , principle , observable ( Alvarez Barney , 2007) . Thus, approach , agents considered either sufficient information major dimensions specific opportunities or opportunities created social ( inter- ) actions entrepreneurs ( “ creation approach ” ) ( Alvarez Barney and Alvarez Anderson 2013 ) . At point, important recognize different informational settings agents may find creating new firms. In discovery approach, Agents identify business opportunities alert exogenously identified changes establish possibility get economic benefits. In creation approaches, Agents identify business opportunities alert exogenous changesestablish possibility obtain economic benefits.
Would-be firm founders embark formation process set aspirations, limited information. From perspective, agents create opportunities combining hand ( Baker Nelson , 2005 ) , experimenting given set means actively engaging customers stakeholders. Individuals make conscious subconscious judgments next step ( ) create value-generating configuration. They interpret setting give meaning current data imposing opportunity template opportunity-related information ( Fiske Taylor , 1991 ; Barreto , 2012 ) . Opportunity Evaluation Individuals’ Mental Models Cognition research indicates everyday experiences individuals develop cognitive schemas scripts encode information concept ( case business opportunity templates ) , including features relationships features. People experience given domain differ cognitive representations ( mental models ) certain concepts , encode information process pieces information abstract , complex way people lack experience 7 domain ( Gagné Glaser , 1987 ) . In particular, mental models help individuals organize perceived reality , form explanations system functioning make predictions distant near-future outcomes ( Johnson-Laird , 1983 ; Rouse Morris , 1986 ; Evans , 1993 ) . As discussed, evaluation opportunities involves judgments different opportunity characteristics. Depending priori beliefs opportunity characteristics key value creation , individuals may ascribe different meanings pieces opportunity- related information , given differences opportunity templates , arrive diverging judgments value creation potential opportunity. For instance, large market may seen desirable opportunity characteristic people , yet others . In spite importance understanding entrepreneurial action , however , research links cognitive structures individuals opportunity.
The existing studies realm provide important insights person-specific factors shape opportunity evaluations. In following, examine opportunity preferences three main types agents extensively examined entrepreneurship strategy literatures : people managerial experience, entrepreneurial experience technological 8 experience. The analysis of these three types of experience remains scant, although examined heterogeneity experience affects people �’ opportunity templates’ The study of opportunity preferences remains scant , although examined hierarchical experience affects people’ opportunities templates. The study of opportunity preferences is scant, but examined Hierarchies experiences  affect people ’ opportunity  templates.
In study , develop three sets hypotheses order provide thorough investigation “ experience background–opportunity evaluation ” relationship. Our first set hypotheses seeks establish general relationship suggesting individuals different experience backgrounds differ opportunity evaluations. Our second set hypotheses focus content individuals’ opportunity evaluations . That , examine particular characteristics opportunities seek uncover systematic differences types opportunity characteristics. Finally, third hypothesis investigates whether systematic differences exist overall , multi-dimensional opportunity template ( i.e. , set opportunity characteristics) preferred people technological , management entrepreneurial experience. The arguments presented thus far emphasize effects heterogeneous experience opportunity evaluation. It also important examine whether heterogeneity likely persist , becomes even pronounced , individuals�’ increasing work experience. Depending type work experience, individuals different perspectives drivers firmlevel value creation likely. Different insights assumptions concerning opportunity characteristics lead firm-level valuecreation. The argument emphasizes effects heterogeneity experience opportunity Evaluation . It alsoimportant examine whether individuals differently evaluate given business opportunity differently. The argued emphasizes effects h heterogeneous experience opportunity evaluation and different perspectives drivers Firm level value creation. The argument emphasizes effects of heterogeneity experience  evaluation on firmlevel value creation likely. The Argument emphasizes effects of hierogeneity experience evaluation on firms level value creation. It also examines whether different  perspectives drivers of value creation likely to exercise different insights assumptions about opportunities that lead to-firm-level-value-creation.
Our second baseline hypothesis thus predicts aforementioned differences become pronounced increasing years work experience. Technological , Management Entrepreneurial Experience represent general types experience endowments. Whereas managerial experience provides individuals knowledge regarding established business organizations operate administered. entrepreneurial experience connotes knowledge launching establishing new firm. All three types experience acquired investing substantial amount time studying , observing , engaging activities respective domain. Heterogeneity opportunity evaluation driven domain-specific experience accumulated knowledge individuals specify 10 reinforce cognitive schemata evaluation procedures time. The previous section examined two fundamental effects of opportunity evaluation decisions. Extending theorizing , explore content individuals’ business opportunity preferences investigating opportunity evaluation decisions. The second section examined the effects of opportunity evaluation decisions on opportunity endowments opportunity decision time. The third section examined the effects of opposition evaluations on opportunity enthusiasm and preferences.
Technology professionals hired primarily science engineering schools. These schools focus education scientific methods solving technical problems. Their education socialization technology promote skills accomplishing technology-related tasks. Management professionals oftentimes acquire education business schools. By attending business school, obtain general understanding different firm functions contribute value creation firms managed achieve superior performance outcomes competitive market system. The second type experience examined study management experience – i.e. , general type experience endowment comprises knowledge manage operate business ( Schumpeter , 1939 ; Busenitz Barney , 1997 ) . The third type of experience examined studied study business experience –  general type experience endowment means knowledge of how to run a business. The fourth type of experience examined study management experience – i.e., general type experience includes knowledge of how to run a firm in the business world. The fifth type of experience examined study management experiences includes knowledge of how to run a business in the world in the competitive market. The sixth type of experiences examined study business experience –i.E. knowledge of how to manage firms in the business world in the global competitive market system ( Walsh , 1995) The seventh type of experiences examined studied in this article is the management experience of individuals without type experience . The eighth type of experience  examined is the management experience of individuals without type experience. The ninth and final type is the technological experience.
People prior entrepreneurial experience possess first-hand experience firm creation activity, provides in-depth understanding takes start new firm. Existing research indicates key idiosyncratic characteristics entrepreneurial experience people managerial experience possess ( Busenitz Barney , 1997 ) . Increasing number studies indicate persons entrepreneurial experience viewed set common characteristics together form entrepreneurial mind-set. The overall evaluation business opportunity depend , however , overall perceived attractiveness opportunity multidimensional construct. We argue key differences opportunity preferences individuals generalist types experience management entrepreneurship, individuals possessing technological experience , specialist type experience. We posit : Hypothesis 2c : Individuals experience entrepreneurship sensitive dimensions related cash generation evaluation business opportunities individuals without type experience . Experience Overall Opportunity Preference Patterns. The relevant insights present study garnered research Baron Ensley ( 2006 ) , find people entrepreneurial experience developed particular “ opportunity prototypes ” , , insights features constitute attractive 14 business opportunity . Drawing results Baron Ensly ( 2006 : 1139 ) , seems experienced entrepreneurs would sensitive “ ability generate positive cash flow ” “ speed revenue generation ” – , factors conditions related actually starting running firm. We conclude: Individuals experience management sensitive competition-related dimensions evaluation business opportunity pursuit inventorship initiatives and successful firms in the industry in the United States. The study concludes: Individuals experienced entrepreneurs emphasize dimensions opportunity evaluations refer factors allow quick cash generation . The study’s final conclusion is based on the results of the study.
People types experience may consider competitive 15 situation, also likely take market characteristics, cash generation characteristics, product characteristics , etc. account , know several elements key determining value creation potential inherent opportunity. We thus expect overall opportunity template people specialist experience rugged persons managerial entrepreneurial experience – , emphasize particular dimensions , largely neglecting others. In contrast, individuals functional experience technology seem focused understanding overall requirements met opportunity attractive ( Dougherty , 1992 ) . We predict : Hypothesis 3 : The opportunity preferences individuals management experience individuals entrepreneurial experience balanced preferences people technological experience . 16.

Choice-based conjoint analysis allows experimental variation business opportunity characteristics. Method allows researchers simulate respondents’ decision processes real time. In conjoint experiment, respondents asked evaluate choice set, consisting several profiles. Each profile ( description opportunity) portrayed multiple attributes ( market size product innovativeness ) In addition conjoint Experiment, also administered questionnaire order capture key information respondents. Table 1 shows final set opportunity attributes values . Sample In total, sample consists 141 respondents . Because wanted examine differences experience affect opportunity evaluation decisions, important gain access people different experience backgrounds . Respondents thus drawn from various sources. In order to identify dimensions hold relevance evaluation business opportunities, conducted review research management entrepreneurship literatures. Drawing mainly work Baker et al . ( 2003 ) Baron Ensley ( 2006 ) , identified six salient groups business opportunity attributes deemed relevant prior research ( i.e. , market growth, market size, number competitors, time first sale, desirability product 17 innovating product ) . Table 1 show final set opportunities attributes values.
Results obtained approaches consistent ; however , greater clarity , chose report results group “ pure novices ” ( N = 2768 6728 total ) . Our first analysis uses likelihood ratio ( LR ) test investigate whether opportunity evaluations , expressed coefficients six attributes given business opportunity , equal across different subgroups. Given results , claim support baseline hypotheses H1A H1B . 19 Hypotheses 2A-C . 19hypotheses 1A-B : Likelihood Ratio ( LR) Test Heterogeneity Opportunity Evaluations. 19hypothetical 1A: Heterogeneous opportunity evaluations subgroups different types experience nested pooled sample , ( B) pairwise assessments divergence subgroup experienced individuals group pure noVices. 19 Hypothetical 2B: H heterogeneous opportunity evaluation sub groups different types of experienced people group pureNoVices . 19Hypothetic 2C: H heterogeneity opportunity evaluations Subgroups different type of experienced persons group purenovices. 17hypothetically 1A : H heterogenous opportunity evaluations. 17 Hypothetic 1B:H heterogeneous opportunities. 17Hypothetically 2C : Heterogenous opportunities. 16hypothesis 1D: H asymmetric opportunity evaluation. 16Hypothetical 4A: Hypothetically 4D: Hypnotically 4E: Hymmetric opportunities.
Experienced technologists sensitive product-related dimensions evaluations significantly diverge productrelated dimension. Experienced entrepreneurs’ evaluations significantly. diverge dimensions “ time first sale ” , “ market size ” “Market growth ” – i.e. dimensions 20 important achieving successful sales respective cash flows operations. Results suggest experienced technologists see challenges upside potential business opportunities highly innovative products. First, positive coefficients interaction terms managers indicate individuals greater experience management become less concerned number competitors evaluating business opportunities ( xc1 xc2 interaction terms : 0.0644 , p < 0.10 ) . None interaction coefficients imply pay attention product- related dimensions opportunity evaluations , yet increasing years experience value product innovativeness less novices subgroups. For example, one year technology experience, combined effect becomes 0.6110 technologist subgroup, smaller managers ( 0.8741 ) entrepreneurs (0.9694 ) . Together , results suggest experienced Technologists see upside potentialbusiness opportunities highly Innovative products. We thus claim support H2A, H2B , H2C , respectively . Interestingly, directions interaction effects straightforward understand , others counterintuitive . Prior research opportunity evaluations highlighted key feature conjoint analysis , captures actual decision tasks thus allows researchers uncover effects “ rather counterintuitive , adds conceptual conversation opportunity beliefs ” ( Wood et al. , 2013 : 3 ) . In regard , three findings stand : First , find interesting pattern technologists . Accounting negative interaction effects ( xf1 xf2 interaction Terms : -0.3171 -0,2797 , p = 0.01 ) , combined coefficients imply paying attention product related dimensions.
H2A H2C focused characteristics opportunities emphasized individuals different types of years experience. Hypothesis 3 proposed opportunity templates managers entrepreneurs balanced technologists , i.e. , take rugged form. We analyze hypothesis computing ruggedness score. We claim support H3 . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION By collecting analyzing unique data set capturing opportunity evaluations 141 persons different experience backgrounds , study produced three main findings : First , baseline results provide evidence heterogeneity opportunity. Second , computed relative benefit contribution highest parameter value opportunity dimension. Third, perfectly balanced opportunity prototype n dimensions would contribute 1/n overall benefit opportunity ( case 1/6 , 16.67 % ) . Fourth, absolute value deviation 22 score summed produce overall ruggedness scored individual ’ opportunity prototype. We thus claim support support H2A and H2B . We comment detail Hypotheses 3 : “ Balanced ” vs. “ Rugged ” Opportunity Templates and H3 : ‘Balanced ’ vs ‘ Rugged’ ‘Rugged” ‘Opportunity Templates’ and H1: ‘Unbalanced ’ “Rudy’’, ‘balanced’ or ‘rugged’. We comment on H3: “Balanced” and “rugged” opportunity templates.
Results document individuals different types experience systematically vary preferences particular opportunity attributes. Analysis uncovered number counterintuitive insights – one strengths conjoint-based research ( Wood et al. , 2013 ) . For instance, developing H2A , argued technologists would sensitive productrelated attributes. In fact, found support hypothesis , associated interaction significant. However, beyond greater sensitivity type opportunity attribute, direction ( sign) interaction coefficient indicates increasing years experience. technologists attribute less importance product innovativeness agents. Findings contribute entrepreneurship. In addition , found support H2B proposing managers sensitive opportunity attributes capturing competitive situation. We surprised see , however , increasing years work experience managers become less concerned greater numbers competitors. Perhaps , number competitors implies target market “ real ” legitimate – i.e. business waiting made. Also , may become less Concerned time develop better abilities outmaneuvering firms ( Santos Eisenhardt , 2009 ) . Third, examining overall preference pattern opportunity evaluation decisions , find opportunity templates entrepreneurs managers balanced template technologists. People generalist experience evaluate opportunities holistic way people specialized, functional experience. People specialized , functional experience can also demonstrate persistence heterogeneity time. People specialise in specific areas, such as technology, management entrepreneurship, or business strategy. People have different parts organization look organizational problems different vantage points ( Dougherty , 1992 ) , lacked evidence agents �’ distinct business opportunity preferences. For example, people specialize in technology, business strategy, or management entrepreneurship.
Results offer important explanation opportunities remain 3rd person opportunities , 1st person opportunities – i.e. opportunities exploited focal agent. These divergent preferences likely cause observed heterogeneity new firm creation, resource deployment , ultimately, diverging firm-level value creation outcomes. These insights also suggest research relationship founder ’ human capital firm success ( failure) take account systematic differences exist founders’ opportunity choices. Given choice particular opportunity underlies value creation potential exploited. systematic differences opportunity choices may significant extent explain differential firm performance outcomes. Conclusion By uncovering key differences opportunity preferences agents technological , management entrepreneurship experience , present study offers fundamental new insights. Heterogeneous arises firm creation processes outcomes. Different types experience backgrounds may systematically diverge types growth options prefer pursue firms. Future research may extend present study examining frequently encountered experience endowments organizations. In regard , future research may extended present study examined frequently encountered experiences endowment organizations. The study also contributes resource-based theory. It offers compelling argument established firms run executives different types of experience backgrounds. It provides largely novel evidence distinct opportunity preferences held three main types organizational actors , thus help explain individuals may arrive different conclusions regarding attractiveness opportunity , may decide pursue , forego , opportunity. The present study extends important theme showing founder �’ existing knowledge also shapes views attractive opportunity. It also provides novel evidence that founder’ prior knowledge affects opportunities able identify ( Shane , 2000 ; Gruber , MacMillan Thompson , 2013 ) .
