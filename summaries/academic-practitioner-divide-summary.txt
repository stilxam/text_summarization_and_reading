Lean startup framework is popular contributions practitioner-oriented entrepreneurship literature recent past. This lean startup framework mobilizing entrepreneurs many cities around world regular meetups exchange experiences learn. In this article, we briefly discuss origins framework, describe main building blocks lean startupframework ( i.e. , practitioner perspective) and enrich existing research insights. We also point promising new research opportunities way generates new insights . In , we hope make several contributions to this article. We hope this article will help you understand the benefits of lean startup Framework and how it can be applied to your own business. We are happy to help you with any questions you may have about this article or any of the contributions we have made to it.
New venture startup define field entrepreneurship , certainly one field ’ unique aspects ( Gartner , 1988 ) . In essence, startups important ( Fritsch , 1997 ) difficult research , therein lies major research opportunity. First, using practitioner framework organize current future research startups. Second, beyond practical importance, research startups broader theoretical significance work antecedent substantial research streams established organizations management, organizational behavior, strategic management. Third, substantial research new ventures increased understanding organizations’ strategies ( McDougall et al. , 1992 ; Sandberg & Hofer , 1987 ) , networks ( Al-Laham & Souitaris , 2008 ; Manolova et al., 2010 ) , performance ( Cooper etAl. , 1994 ; Jin etal. , 2017 ) . While study primarily focuses bridging research–practice gap specifying novel research questions arise framework highly popular practice remains under-researched, note discussion also offers insights scholars make research accessible to students, educators and practitioners. The study was published in the Journal of Entrepreneurial Studies, a peer-reviewed journal published by the Association for the Study of Entrepreneurship, a division of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
The lean startup framework originated work Blank , 2013. Blank criticized fact many startups begin product idea spend significant time, effort , financial resources perfecting without knowing whether would able meet customer needs generate revenues. Instead, proposed entrepreneurs adopt outward-looking learning mindset. Blank offered first set tools ( customer development, agile engineering, minimum viable product [ MVP ] ) to help entrepreneurs accomplish search, learning, validation activities. Another key contribution lean Startup Framework provided Osterwalder Pigneur ( 2010 ) . Specifically, dissertation research , OsterWalder ( 2004) positioned startup design science framework. It is based ( natural ) scientific method ; design science approach discussed management ( e.g. , Romme , 2003 ) entrepreneurship. It description value company offers one several segments customers architecture firm network partners creating , marketing , delivering value relationship capital , generate profitable sustainable revenue streams. ( Berglund et al. , 2018 ; Dimov , 2016 )
Eric Ries, entrepreneur student Steve Blank ’ customer development class University California, Berkeley, popularized concept in 2011 book. Ries dubbed combination customer development, agile engineering, Business Model Canvas as ‘Lean Startup’ New tool “ Market Opportunity Navigator’ provides wide-lens perspective find different potential market domains innovation, zoom design business model test minimal viable products. Tool serve front end customer-development process allows entrepreneurs identify choose promising starting position lean startup process. Most insights underlying Market OpportunityNavigator derived from series research studies market choice startups ( Gruber et al. , 2008 , 2010 , 2012 ; 2013 ; McGrath & MacMillan , 2000 ; Tal-Itzkovitch etal. , 2012 ) . Building Blocks Lean Startup Framework. The next key development stage lean startup framework proposed by Eric Ries is called ‘The Lean Startup Method’.
The lean startup framework five primary building blocks : ( ) finding prioritizing market opportunities startups, ( b ) designing business models, ( c ) validated learning ( including customer development ) , ( d ) building minimum viable products ( MVPs ) and ( e) learning whether persevere pivot current course action. In Figure 1, depict framework ’ building blocks work concert support entrepreneurs startup process. In following, discuss building blocks, review research themes ( ) inform building block, provide ideas future research could help advance understanding building block framework entirety. In highlighting research themes offering future research opportunities, make deliberately suggestions differ philosophical theoretical perspectives require range different methods.
Market Opportunity Navigator provides important learning layer within lean startup framework. Market opportunity startup seeks exploit defines domain wants compete, create value, achieve viability. By enabling entrepreneurs identify portfolio market opportunities choose promising starting position customer development business model design. The goal lean learning find play startup , entrepreneurs also need wide-lens perspective allows perform distant global search play. For instance, Gruber Tal ( 2017) suggested entrepreneurs ’ understand exploit multiple market opportunities , often become aware of different levels uncertainty associated opportunity’. In addition , building idea identification opportunity set also affects likelihood venture diversify thus growth paths venture likely exploit ( Gruber et al. , 2013 ) , early-stage decisions startups influence agility, flexibility , growth paths ventures ? For instance , believe important entrepreneurship field advance knowledge conditions uncertainty differ opportunities differences mean startup process. In particular, interesting note identifying multiple opportunities , entrepreneurs may seek understand relative attractiveness opportunities may also consider different levels of uncertainty associated opportunities. The market opportunity Navigator is based on academic research (Gruber & Thiel , 2009 ; McGrath & MacMillan , 2000 ; Tal-Itzkovitch et al., 2012 ) and is designed to help entrepreneurs identify and exploit market opportunities in a variety of industries. It also provides a framework for business models, such as customer development and customer acquisition.
Identifying portfolio opportunities allows entrepreneurs engage multiple experiments simultaneously. Key early decisions ( e.g. picking brand name could fit several markets, hiring employees flexible human capital , etc. ) enhance firm ’ agility later. As build understanding real options reasoning startup process experimentation, may able help practitioners better manage uncertainty face starting new venture. Second, key step Market Opportunity Navigator choose promising option . While real options approach helps entrepreneurs learn options parallel, decision offers important research questions. For example, line Collis ’ ( 2016) observation perhaps single best piece of advice founders know ( resource-constrained organization requires strategy specifies boundaries ) , would interesting investigate options entrepreneurs discard early process. Finally, generally, logic underlying Market Opportunity is the same as that underlying hypothesis testing ( McGrath , 1999 , 2010 ) . When hypothesis testing reveals information suggesting positive future , founder makes investments , referred exercising option . Important perspective understanding options play ( McGraths , 1999 ) . Although easier imagine real options Reasoning approach established firms engaged process starting new ventures ( de alio ) , important consider notion portfolio opportunities ( requiring hypothesis testing ) independent startups ( de novo ) . For example , Denoo et al . ( 2018 ) found startups broader portfolios customers engage business-model changes changes greater degree. Generally, future research explore extent independent startups portfolios potential opportunities ; form hypotheses take test potential opportunities. For instance, prior studies opportunity choice startups found entrepreneurs ’ understanding opportunity attractiveness depends experience background ( Gruber et al. , 2015 ) . Hence, founders different backgrounds create conduct different types experiments.
Market Opportunity Navigator links lean learning cycles with entrepreneurial mindset. Future research could improve understanding individuals entrepreneurial mindset ( e.g. comparing serial novice entrepreneurs) In turn, results studies could inform application lean startup framework practice. In words , examining startups apply Market Opportunity Navigators link leanlearning cycles, scholars advance knowledge constitutes entrepreneurial mindset strategic entrepreneurship. For example, Hitt et al. ( 2001 , p. 488 ) explained , McGrath MacMillan ( 2000 ) integrated thinking fields developing entrepreneurial mindset concept. They argued entrepreneurial mindset passionately seek new opportunities ( entrepreneurship) . However , also pursue best opportunities pursue discipline ( strategic management ) . In words, examining startups applying Market OpportunityNavigator link lean learning cycle, scholars advanced knowledge constitutes “ strategic entrepreneurship ” ( Ireland et al., 2003 ) .
The design business model startup key stepping stone learning journey. Given many features based assumptions , business models provide framework hypotheses related venture creation venture growth formulated. From academic perspective, business models application startups garnered significant scholarly interest. From perspective business models firm attribute ( Massa et al. , 2017 ) , focus existing firms—not existing firms. For example, firms ’ activities create value ( i.e. , business model firm attribute ) impact entrepreneurs’ mental maps attending, interpreting, narrating business models. For. example, businesses’ cognitive linguistic schemas shape activities reflecting firms ? How refined conceptualizations, represent configurations ( e.g. , Gruber et. , 2010 ) simply additive elements ? Second, develop practice perspective business Models . From perspectiveBusiness Model Canvas widely used framework among startups. Although need construct clarity within across papers ( Suddaby, 2010 ) , perspectives (e.g., philosophical theoretical approaches ) provide opportunity shed new light business models . We recognize knowledge accumulation diverse perspectives becomes difficult ( across papers homogenous perspectives ) , mean impossible. We recognize need for clarity within within papers ( Lant, 1992 ; Martins et.al. , 2015 ) and within perspectives (E.G. , Denoo, 2018 ; Lant & Rosenbloom, 2002 ) .
Firms ’ business models make important contribution entrepreneurship. Future research take nuanced micro-perspective focus configurations activities involved creating and/or capturing value. By focusing activities, sequence activities , enablers , begin develop practice perspective business models. In addition filling theoretical gap , practice perspectiveBusiness models implications practitioners students illustrating entrepreneurs. Third, develop micro-cognitive perspective business model . Although good understanding entrepreneurial cognition related identification opportunities ( Grégoire et al. , 2010 ) , entrepreneurial decision making ( review ) , cognitive underpinnings entrepreneurial action ( review , see Gré gooire & Zott , 2011 ) , paid sufficient attention entrepreneurs’ cognitive schemas develop business models ( Denoo & Yli-Renko , 2019 ) . Indeed, Snihur Zott ( 2019) found founders �’ structural cognitive imprints explain business model innovation emerges persists time . Therefore, future research build streams research make important contributions knowledge investigating nature entrepreneurs�’ cognitions business models , cognitive schema formed , implications attention allocation ( inattention ) , decision making , beliefs , actions toward enactment business model. creation new independent firm. The study was published in the Journal of Entrepreneurial Studies, a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences, a division of the University of California, Los Angeles.
Business-model innovation leads enhanced startup progress ( Denoo et al. , 2018 ) performance ( Cucculelli & Bettinelli , 2015 ; Zott & Amit , 2007 ) . Although recent advancements business- model innovation macro-management level ( e.g. , Foss & Saebi , 2017 ) , need micro-perspective business-model Innovation. Future research build literature learning experimentation ( Achtenhagen & McGrath , 2010 ) structural cognitive imprints ( Snihur & Zott , 2019 ) gain deeper understanding antecedents business-Model innovation. This cognitive perspective implications scholars also important implications practitioners students providing information founding teams collectively think business models. Fourth, develop narrative perspective business models . Narratives stories offer “ temporally sequenced accounts interrelated events actions undertaken characters ” ( Martens et al., 2007 ) This narrative perspective considerable benefit practitioners students learn different business- Model stories , different elements stories , methods effectively communicate stories. Finally, develop innovation-based perspective business Models . Analyzing formal informal stories business models likely provide new insights sensemaking process, identification potential stakeholders , development potential opportunities tied to business- Models. , stakeholders . Therefore, advance cognitive perspective business model investigating development nature founding teams’ shared cognitions business models ways shared cognition change result internal external feedback business models, for example. For example, shared cognitive schemas business models change time , effective others making changes ?.
Research outcomes business-model innovation focused firm performance. For example, scholars firm performance typically take corporate perspective creation business models within existing firms ( de alio ventures) When perspective focused business- model innovation applied creation new independent organizations ( de novo ventures ) , traditional measures of firm performance less applicable ( e.g. , distal ) Business model innovation influences entrepreneurs’ activities, cognitions , narratives ( outcome input ) , gain deeper understanding dynamics of startup process. This dynamic perspective business-Model innovation likely benefit practitioners students providing information potential feedback effects of business model innovation. By understanding antecedents different forms business- Model Innovation, practitioners students begin understand steps developing novel useful business models. For. example, activities , cognitions, narratives may influence business- Models. Entrepreneurs acquire resources necessary to implement original idea business model. For for example, business- models. may influence startup ’ activities , founding team cognitions. , narratives. As understand nature potentially mutually dependent relationships, we may able detect virtuous ( and/or deleterious ) spirals.
A startup ’ initial business model based series hypotheses need tested validated ( Blank , 2013 ) . From perspective Business Model Canvas , nine key elements startups subject validated learning ( Osterwalder & Pigneur , 2010 ) Ries ( 2011) “ process demonstrating empirically team discovered valuable truths startup �’ present future prospects. ” This notion line discovery-driven planning approach , McGrath MacMillan ( 1995) proposed entrepreneurs acting conditions high uncertainty need convert assumptions facts create viable new ventures. These notions experimenting validated learning part startup process already support academic literature ( cf . McGrath & MacMillAn , 1995 ) , need research. The associated tests attempt address following four questions : “ ( 1) Do customers recognize problem trying solve ? ( 2) If solution , would buy ? ( 3) Would buy [ solution ] us ? ( 4) Can build solution problem ” ( Ries , 2011 ) . The validated learning approach experimentation tests assumptions ensure founders skip Questions 1–3 focus immediately building solution ( Question 4 ) . These notions experimenters open possibility hypotheses disconfirmed , case , need develop new hypotheses empirical testing . Of particular importance customer development process , entrepreneurs examine test hypotheses related market customers ( Blank & Dorf , 2012 ) . Building market-size hypothesis ( i.e. , attractive target market opportunity ; see Blank, 2012 ) , learning involves elements like firm ’ value proposition , customer segments , channels reach customers.
Scientific method hypothesis testing ( advocated lean startup framework ) may overcome , least minimize , confirmation bias. An intriguing research opportunity regard whether skepticism-oriented approach hypothesis testing validated learning ( scientific method implies ) belief-oriented approaches provide greater promise learning conditions. In way, hypothesis testing process sensemaking implementation scientific method . Sensemaking involves “ ongoing retrospective development plausible images rationalize people ” ( Weick et al. , 2005) Future research explore activities founders engage searching, collecting, analyzing information testing hypothesis set hypotheses ( e.g. , overarching logic business model examined ) . In addition question asked , future research explore Activities founders engage in searching, collect, analyzing. information testing. In addition, future research explores activities founders engaged in. testing startup hypotheses ( including involvement in the development of a business model) . In way , hypothesis testing involves ‘taking account one ’ experience informs subsequent actions hypotheses . Therefore, belief model hypothesis testing, startup ( i.e. , business model ) becomes plausible . Indeed , startups become plausible “ tap ongoing sense current climate , consistent data , facilitate ongoing projects , reduce equivocally , provide aura accuracy offer potentially exciting future ”. For example, Elkington Hartigan ( 2008 ) proposed individuals may able achieve revolutionary accomplishments faith conjectures. For. example, John Suddaby ( 2017) proposed people may be able to achieve revolutionary feats.
Founders’ empathetic judgments inform formation testing hypotheses startups. Because hypotheses often based others ( especially potential customers) respond problems solutions underlie startup ’ business model. Empathetic accuracy refers entrepreneurs’ capability “ accurately estimate infer others’ preferences well enough form expectations” ( McMullen , 2015) Future research explore extent founders apply disciplined imagination discipline thought trials test hypothesis startup ‘ business model effects subsequent cognitions ( including formation subsequent search activities development startup narrative time ) We assume nascent entrepreneurs have prosocial motivation ( e.g. , focused known vs. unknown others) to start a business. It seems hypotheses hybrid startup ( economic social logic ) complex require different testing strategy startup solely economic logic . Third , implied , likely heterogeneity formation hypotheses test veracity startup �’ businessmodel . Indeed, formation testing hypothesis vary extent derive disciplined imagination . Scholars largely explored disciplined imagination context scholars ’ theorizing ( Shepherd & Sutcliffe , 2011 ; Weick , 1989 ) , concept potential clarify heterogeneity founders ’ hypothesis formation testing . The discipline disciplined imagination involves consistent application selection criteria test hypothesis , imagination facilitates “ deliberate diversity introduced problem statements , thought trials , selection criteria compile thinking ” ( Weick, 1989 ) . This notion thought experiments opens possibility cheap means testing hypotheses cognitive perspective . It seems. hypothesis testing means provide external feedback assumptions underlying founders’ hypotheses , hypothesis testing involve thought trials—abstract hypothetical scenarios ( Harggqvist , 1996 ) serve imaginary experiments.
 apply disciplined imagination hypothesis testing outside minds , provides opportunity investigate activities responses external feedback . Practitioners students stand benefit research disciplined imagination testing hypotheses startup ’ veracity . Perhaps eventually , offer prescriptions conduct startup hypothesis testing approaches disciplined imaginative .
In lean startup framework, experiment “ theoretical inquiry ; also first product ” ( Ries , 2011 ) , developed agile product-development process. MVP contain critical features envisioned product designed to test specific hypothesis quickly. As result, features added MVP contribute learning considered waste resources. Although claims MVPs distinct prototypes, believe research prototyping provide insights “ minimum ” MVPs. Although often think MVPs three-dimensional objects , perhaps sketches ( e.g. , Cross , Cross ) —the overall argument MVPs critical progress starting new venture. The entrepreneurship literature inform understanding notion MVP. Future research make important contribution understanding startup process delving deeply into attributes prototype make MVP. For example, best way ( fast, cheap, informative ) make something intangible seem tangible ? For example , best way to make something “intangible” seem “sharable” ( i.e. “right ” ) ? For instance, best to make a potential opportunity tangible, sharable, understandable stakeholders reject , prototype MVP served purpose vehicle learning. The purpose MVP learn—to test assumptions ( hypotheses ) underlying startup ’ business model ( Blank & Dorf , 2012 ) —to test the assumptions ( assumptions) underlying startup’s business model. The question founders much time , energy , resources invest building product used hypothesis testing .
The need research applies dimensions developing prototype sharable understandable. Different versions MVPs needed depending nature target audience. There ample opportunities future research explore MVP operates boundary object. Research MVPs boundary objects likely reveal information practitioners students development “ best use ” MVP testing specific hypotheses , learning , advancing startup process. Finally, MVP boundary object , might business model . That , rather ( addition ) building MVP boundary objects sharing , transferring , transforming knowledge , founder use business model. With increased understanding nature different borders obstacles flow information knowledge , begin explore effectiveness different boundary objects bridging different boundaries experienced start. It important learn tools founders use create MVPs tools effective others making intangible tangible . We assume sharable understandable one set stakeholders may less another set stakeholders—thus, different versions of MVPs are needed depending on nature target audiences. We assume tangibility, sharability, understandability determine effectiveness MVP different audiences . Second, specific laid , MVPs boundaries objects facilitate communication . It difficult transfer knowledge across boundaries like boundary emerging startup stakeholder groups, potential customers ( Nonaka , 1994 ; Polanyi , 1966 ) , knowledge often embedded practice ( Bourdieu , 1977 ; Lave , 1988 ) . A boundary object artifact “ provides bridge individuals triangulating something common ( Carlile , 2004 ) reducing time required sensemaking ” ( Grichnik et al. , 2016 , p. 14)
Business model represent object flexible mix narratives communicate heterogeneous stakeholders sufficiently robust represent common source information knowledge across boundaries. For example, business model act market device— “ material discursive assemblage intervenes construction markets ” ( Muniesa et al. , 2007 ) . Scholars opportunity explore boundary objects, crowdfunding requests pitches potential investors. Does notion MVP apply business model formal representation ? How founders create crowdfunding message offers best mechanism exchange information refine business model ( necessarily raise funds ) ? How pitches raising capital differ pitches facilitating exchange stakeholders hypothesis testing learn ? As build knowledge formal representation business models boundary objects , practitioners students benefit better understanding building using boundary objects learn refine business models. The idea that founders create minimum viable business plan represents enough investment time, energy , resources provide mechanism exchange info necessary to test veracity business model. The notion MVP applies business models formal representation? That, founders createMinimum Viable Business Plan (MVP) is a formal conceptual representation of a business model that represents a firm’s activities.
In lean startup method, pivot “ structured course correction designed test new fundamental hypothesis product , strategy , engine growth ” ( Ries , 2011) A successful pivot thus allow startup move closer reach sustainable , repeatable business model allow venture grow. The alternative pivot persevere current solution . The important question facing founders is whether pivot-or-persevere meetings set advance. By effectively pivoting, startups become resilient entrepreneurs ’ mistakes changes external environment. The lean startup framework proposes benefits setting learning milestones triggers accumulating information make persevere- or-pivot decisions milestones test assumptions founder made explicit beginning startup process. This trial-and-error learning rather local incremental ( Gavetti & Levinthal , 2000 ) . While founder persevere incremental steps refine startup ’ current business model , founder may learn incremental changes generate sufficient progress startup , leads decision pivot ( Figure 1 ) (Figure 1: Building Block 5: Persevere Pivot With Course Action) (Figure 2: Building block 5: Persevere Pivot with Course Action ) ( Figure 2: Persevering P pivot with Course action) ( Figure 3: Persevere P pivoting with course action)(Figure 3: Pivot and course action). (Figure 4: P pivot and course Action). ( Figure 5: BuildingBlock 5: Pivoting and Course Action.) ( Figure 6: Buildingblock 5: The Pivot- or Course Action).
In one empirical studies pivots , Denoo et al . ( 2018) found less 40 % young firms changed business model 10-year period. Overcoming reluctance pivot appears require reappraisal psychological ownership , idea work , identity work. We need research considers termination decision alternative along pivot-or-persevere decision. By drawing research learning failure ( McGrath , 1999 ; Sitkin , 1992 ) , challenges coping grief projects lost failure ( Shepherd , 2003 ; Shepherd & Sutcliffe , 2011 ) . organizational cultures provide psychological safety members fail learn experience ( Cannon & Edmondson , 2005 ; Edmondsson , 1999; review , see Ucbasaran et al. , 2013 ) . For practitioners students, it important understand failure occur given high uncertainty involved starting firm failure typically hurts, also need understand failure ( i.e. , fail quickly cheaply ) important means managing uncertainty . It important perpetuate antifailure bias future founders . Third, heterogeneity pivots, implications learning ( Achtenhagen et.al. ,2013 ; Denoo & Eisenhardt , 2014 ) performance ( i-e. growth survival ; Andries et al., 2013) . Indeed, Ries ( 2011) said runway refers “ amount time remaining startup must either achieve lift fail ” ( Ries , 2011) .
The extreme version perseverance change either dimension . The extreme version pivot Blank ( 2013) referred to restart Wood et al. ( 2019) referred complete pivot. By considering extent refinement pivots, future research develop richer theories antecedent , mechanisms , consequences pivots. Future research explore conditions pivoting ( various forms degree ) likely given information indicating need change. The cultures emerging organization founding teams likely impact effectiveness pivot-or-persevere meetings. For example, perhaps feeling psychological safety — “ shared belief held members team team safe inter-personal risk taking ” —meeting participants likely decide pivot ( consistent previous point , pivot greater extent ) . Future research also explore the impact of pivots on startups’ business models, communities inquiry founders’ narratives, and the culture of the emerging organization as well as other factors that influence pivoting in the startup world. The extreme pivot consistent notion termination particular startup effort . In many ways, the extreme version pivots consistent notion terminate particular startup efforts. For instance, the complete pivot isabandoning “ initial offering favor completely new concept. ” ( Blank, 2013) or “ pivoting to a completely different concept” ( Wood, 2019) The extreme pivots cause startups to change their business models and communities to change how they think about the startup experience. The extremes pivot can be consistent with the extreme pivot concept, or a completely new idea.
Entrepreneurial self-efficacy may promote persevering terminating , may also promote pivoting persevering. Future research opportunity unpack notion runway provide connections runway pivoting , speed , learning , cost. If runway refers “ amount time remaining startup must either achieve lift fail ” ( Ries , 2011 ) , future research investigate many potential independent variables detailed differences results. If ‘ runway refers number pivots startup still make ’ (Ries, 2011), future research should investigate whether number pivotots remaining influenced ( ) extent refinement pivot; ( b) type pivot ; ( c) quality, testing , results hypothesis testing ; ( ) cost pivot ( including startups ’ agility past decisions may make pivoting costly ) ; ( e) capacity stakeholders absorb pivots; ( f) number pivot already performed ; ( g) founders’ capacity, skills, abilities conduct absorb pivot ; ( h) startups’ on-hand resources and/or recommitments stakeholders. The ideas in this article are the result of a collaboration between Cassar & Friedman and Wood et al. ( 2019) and Gimeno & Friedman ( 1997) and were published in the Journal of Entrepreneurial Research, volume 4, issue 1, page 1.
Longer runway ( number pivots amount time left ) increases likelihood liftoff , failure occurs , increases losses failure. Future research will investigate relationship number pivot time left number time left. Research will explore factors strengthen weaken relationship.
Overarching perspective: scholars investigate key topics, framework’ performance implications, ( b) imprinting effects applying lean startup approach, ( c) contingencies ( including external context ) may condition applicability effects performance. In preceding sections, discussed five building blocks lean startup framework block represents opportunity future research. An initial important step direction recently taken Gambardella et al . ( press ) . They showed scientific approach startup creation—consistent many features lean startup approaches discussed above—leads successful ventures. In addition, studying web-based startups, Marmer et al. ( 2012 ) found learning-focused, agile approach Startup creation leads relatively successful ventures . Building first empirical insights, believe would interesting examine overall performance effects applyingLean Startup Framework. For instance, given many meetup groups around world entrepreneurs discuss experience lean startup Framework. scholars could sample ventures created approach compare performance matched samples startups employed approach. Third, respect contingency factors , important understand conditions applying lean Startup Framework may lead less beneficial outcomes. For for instance, Blank ( Blank) et al ( 2013) found that lean Startup approach decreases likelihood entrepreneurs pursue venture projects false-negative returns. In the next section, we look at the impact of lean Startup framework on business models, product introductions, social networks, building status, legitimacy and alliances. We also look at how lean startup captures outcomes number of different ways, including firm performance, innovation culture, new product introduction and development social networks.
 lean startup framework well pose interesting research questions. For instance, usefulness lean startup approach vary different types technologies. We offer four broad categories contexts Figure 2 . We propose broader perspective boundary conditions moderators may influence applicabilityLean startup framework beyond model longer applies—perhaps , example , context low uncertainty considerable resource slack. We are primarily interested lean startup method may apply , primarily interestedLean startup approach differs different contexts. Figure 2 , surround model oval represent context model embedded . Figure 2, surroundmodel oval representcontext model embedded. Figure 3, surround model Oval represent contextmodel embedded.Figure 4, context may represent boundary conditions lean startupframework beyond model no longer applies. Figure 5, context low Uncertainty considerable Resource slack. Figure 6, Context low Unccertainty considerableResource Slack. Figure 7, Context high Uncertainties considerable Resource Slack.
Community inquiry is an informal group stakeholders involved evaluation development potential opportunity. These members ( startups ’ communities inquiry ) may include users, customers, technologists, scientists. First, practitioners offered lean startup framework way learn conditions uncertainty ( Blank , 2013 ; Ries , 2011 ) Second, environmental context typically represented strategic management literature terms resource scarcity , volatility , complexity ( Dess & Beard , 1984 ) Third, question address whether approach less relevance predictable conditions—that, lean startup less effective entrepreneurs choose create venture exploit potential opportunity relatively low uncertainty ( e.g. munificent environment ) ? This idea analogous Gruber ’ finding “ highly dynamic environments, entrepreneurs gain [ ] value planning focus select planning activities , speed planning task . . . [ whereas ] less dynamic environments , better pursuing munificent approach planning ” ( 2007 : 782 ) . Perhaps greater environmental dynamism , wider lens needed generate sufficient set potential opportunities , simultaneous experiments required gather variety information , frequent need MVPs . Perhaps complex environments ( vis-à-vis dichotomy ) . Therefore, rather assuming startups face environmental conditions ( involve entrepreneurial action ) , opportunity explore different levels various environmental dimensions influence lean startup process. This idea is similar to Gruber’s finding ‘highly dynamic environments,. entrepreneurs gain value planning. focus select activities ,Speed planning task’ ( 2007: 782)
Startups appear play important role addressing ( also exacerbating ; Shepherd et al. , 2013) natural environmental issues. However, lean startup process differ business models focused on positive outcomes. Future research make important contribution startup literature exploring moderating role various environmental dimensions. The natural environment needs protected damage , current damage needs mitigated. The notion hybridity also applies grand societal challenges , proposed Sustainable Development Goals United Nations, including climate change, inequality poverty ( e.g. , Wry & Zhao , 2018 ) and deterioration communities local cultures. In sum , preceding sections portrayed different building blocks lean startup framework outlined several important opportunities future research. Table 1 Figure 2 provide overview main ideas discussed. Table 2 Figure 1 provide overview of key ideas discussed in this article. Table 3 Figure 1 provides overview of main ideas in this report. Table 4 Figure 1 is a summary of the main ideas and concepts discussed in the study. Table 5 Figure 2 is a table of key concepts in this study. The main ideas are that startups embedded lean Startup process may play an important role in addressing natural environment issues. For example, startup process needs rely elaborate MVPs , alternatively, narrow MVPs test different aspects environment . Future research makes important contribution to lean startup literature explore moderating roles of startups in environmental challenges. The study concludes that lean startup may play a key role in the future of the global economy.
In article, took building blocks lean startup method—a practitioner perspective startup process. Five building blocks inspired many ideas ways scholars engage future research. The hope future research continue close practitioner–academic gap. Not every scholar needs play every possible role decreasing practice–ac academic gap. Using academic frameworks make sense current events published interviews, op eds, commentaries, newspapers, magazines, newscasts, podcasts. This transfer knowledge might take form creating extended practical implications sections journal articles; publishing research practitioner-based journals ( e.g. Harvard Business Review, Sloan Management Review, Business Horizons) using academic framework make senseCurrent events make sense “ ready-to-use ” fashion, as illustrated Business Model Canvas ( Osterwalder & Pigneur , 2010 ) Market Opportunity Navigator ( Gruber & Tal , 2017 ) . We believe significant opportunity lies designing business tools draw scholarly knowledge. We hope this article inspires additional research important topic. Our focus article use practice inspiration advancing knowledge startup process entrepreneurship literature, also mindful research eventually help practitioners students. It is hoped this article will help students learn startups, hope article inspires further research. It was published in the online edition of the Journal of Business and Economics, published by Oxford University Press, on November 14, 2013.
